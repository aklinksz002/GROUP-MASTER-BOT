# Telegram Cleanup Bot

This Telegram bot is designed to manage group cleanups and provide additional features like generating invite links, tracking user activity, sending daily reports, and allowing admins to manage the group with ease. The bot supports multiple groups and admins, offering various functionalities like removing inactive members, sending daily reports, and much more.

## Features
- **Daily Cleanup**: Automatically removes non-admin members at 12 AM.
- **Join Link**: Sends a unique invite link every day to users with an "Ask Join Link" button.
- **Admin Reports**: Admins can submit daily and weekly reports.
- **Activity Tracking**: Track user activity and group status.
- **Silent Mode**: Option to mute or restrict notifications during cleanup.
- **Whitelist**: Option to add users to the whitelist so they are not removed during cleanup.
- **Rejoin Requests**: Allows users who are removed to request to rejoin.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **MongoDB** (for storing group settings, reports, and user activity)
- **Pyrogram** (Telegram Python library)
- **APSs Scheduler** (For scheduling cleanup tasks)

You can install the required Python packages by using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **MongoDB Setup**
Make sure you have a MongoDB database running. The bot will use MongoDB to store various data like reports, user activity, settings, and invite links.

- You can either run MongoDB locally or use a cloud provider (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- In the `.env` file, update the `MONGO_URI` to point to your MongoDB instance.

## Configuration
The bot configuration is stored in the `.env` file. Here's a sample configuration:

```plaintext
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### **Telegram API Setup**
To use the Telegram bot, you need to obtain an API ID and API hash by following these steps:

1. Go to [Telegram's Developer Site](https://my.telegram.org/auth).
2. Login and click on **API development tools**.
3. Create a new application and note down the **API ID** and **API hash**.

Update these values in the `.env` file.

### **Running the Bot**

1. **Start the bot**:
   After setting up everything, you can start the bot using:

   ```bash
   python bot/main.py
   ```

2. **Web Server (optional)**:
   If you want to run a web server alongside the bot (for metrics or other purposes), make sure to enable the web server in `webserver.py` and run:

   ```bash
   python bot/main.py
   ```

   This will run both the bot and web server concurrently.

   - The bot tracks when users are **removed** and whether they can **rejoin**.
   
3. **Join Link Management**:
   - The bot generates **daily unique invite links** for the group. The link expires in 24 hours.
   - The **"Ask Join Link"** button allows users to get the current dayâ€™s join link.

4. **Activity and Reporting**:
   - The bot saves **activity logs** and **reports** submitted by admins.
   - Admins can view **past reports** using the `/get_reports` command.

5. **Cleanup Reports**:

- **Database issues**: Ensure that MongoDB is up and running. Check the database connection string in `.env`.
